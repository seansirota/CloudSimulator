# CloudSimulator

## Purpose
This application is meant as a price calculator for purchashing cloud resources. It is not a substitute for real cloud price calculators create by real cloud platforms, but it offers a simplified experience that you can play around with that simulates them. The pricing of each resource types tries to reflect reality as much as possible, however, there is no way of knowing the true pricing of every aspect of a cloud resource unless given the chance to ask big cloud platforms themselves. This is simply a fun tool used to estimate the cost of a fictional cloud platform and its services, and should be only used for fun and not for real professional applications.

## Features
Features of this application include:
* Creating a resource. Resource types include: virtual machines, databases, Kuburnetes clusters, and external storage units.
* Editing an existing resource and changing its parameters or the resource type entirely.
* Deleting resources from table.
* Selecting all resources in table or deselecting all resources.
* Filtering data grid of resources by resource type.
* Exporting data grid to CSV file for further analysis.

Some features were cut and may be added in a future update including:
* Cost analysis which gives a breakdown of the cloud spending  by time, hardware type, and resource type.
* Importing data from a CSV file to the data grid for manipulation.
